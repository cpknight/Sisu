Welcome to the `Sisu` repository! This project is a collection of files and materials related to my work on restoring and repairing various vintage devices, primarily from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Occasionally, I also tackle repairs on contemporary devices. Note that this repo is separate from my `cpknight/Torch` project ([github.com/cpknight/Torch](https://github.com/cpknight/Torch)), where I focus on typewriter-related workâ€”please check there if you're looking for my typewriter stuff to avoid confusion. The repo is public to share potentially useful details with others, though not all repairs or restorations are fully documented.

The project/repo name "Sisu" is inspired by a family-owned free trader spaceship from the novel [*Citizen of the Galaxy*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL59679W/Citizen_of_the_Galaxy?edition=key%3A/books/OL10683415M) by [Robert A. Heinlein](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL28641A/Robert_A._Heinlein). The image of the Sisu spaceship used here was generated by ([Grok 3](https://grok.com)), built by xAI ([x.ai](https://x.ai)).
